# 🚆 Indian Railway Schedule Checker (IRCTC API)

This is a Python command-line application that lets users:

- 🔴 Check **live train running status**
- 🧾 View **PNR status** (planned feature)
- 📅 View **complete train schedule** with arrival & departure times, station names, and distance from source

It uses the **IndianRail API** to fetch real-time train data and displays it in a clean format on your terminal.
